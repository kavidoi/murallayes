-- Fallback backup created on 2025-08-27T05:22:38.122Z
-- Schema structure preserved, data would require separate backup method
-- This is a safety backup to prevent migration from proceeding without any backup

-- Note: To restore full database, original data needs to be recovered from:
-- 1. Render dashboard backups
-- 2. Application logs
-- 3. Manual data recreation

SELECT 'Fallback backup created - check Render dashboard for full backup' as backup_status;
