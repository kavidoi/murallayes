## 🎯 Infrastructure Improvement Plan

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)
1. **Implement Application Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Add Sentry for error tracking
   pnpm add @sentry/node @sentry/react
   
   # Configure basic APM
   # Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot/Pingdom)
   ```

2. **Security Hardening**
   ```javascript
   // Add security middleware
   app.use(helmet());
   app.use(rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   }));
   ```

### SHORT-TERM (Next 2 Weeks)
3. **Enhanced Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Set up application metrics collection
   - Configure log aggregation
   - Create performance monitoring dashboard
   - Implement alerting for critical issues

4. **Operational Documentation**
   - Create incident response runbooks
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Establish performance baselines
   - Create capacity planning guidelines

### MEDIUM-TERM (Next Month)
5. **Advanced Infrastructure**
   - Implement Redis for caching
   - Set up background job processing
   - Configure file storage (S3/CloudFlare R2)
   - Add comprehensive security scanning
