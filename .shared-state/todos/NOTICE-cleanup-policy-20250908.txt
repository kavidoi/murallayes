Shared-State Retention Update

Purpose: Keep just-enough context for collaboration across terminals; avoid data hoarding.

Effective immediately:
- Logs: retain 14 days.
- Events: retain 7 days.
- A soft cap of ~500 MB is enforced. Oldest archives/logs/events will be pruned (skipping today) if over cap.
- Older events may be archived per-day to reduce file count and disk usage.

Action for agents:
- Do not rely on historical logs beyond the above windows.
- Prefer concise event records over verbose logs.
- If you see duplicate servers, check sessions and recent logs; cleanup runs regularly.
