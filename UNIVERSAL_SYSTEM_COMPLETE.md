## 🛠️ **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### **1. @ Mention System**
```
Task Description: "Need to coordinate with @John and review @Product-Coffee-Beans for @Project-Q4-Launch"
```
**Result**: Automatically creates 3 relationships:
- John → mentioned_in → Task
- Product-Coffee-Beans → mentioned_in → Task  
- Project-Q4-Launch → mentioned_in → Task

### **2. Universal SKU Generation**
- Products use templates: `CAF-SMT-100-001` (Category-Supplier-Format-Sequence)
- Tasks use templates: `MURALL-T0001` (Project-Task-Sequence)
- Contacts use templates: `SUP-0001` (Type-Sequence)
- Budgets use templates: `BGT-MUR-2024-OPX` (Budget-Project-Year-Category)

### **3. Relationship Intelligence**
- **Auto-Detection**: System finds supplier relationships from purchase patterns
- **Bidirectional Links**: Creating "supplies" automatically creates "supplied_by"  
- **Strength Tracking**: Relationships get stronger with more interactions
- **Rich Metadata**: Context and history stored with every relationship

## 📋 **USER WORKFLOW EXAMPLES**

### **Creating a Task (New Experience)**
1. **Title**: "Review coffee inventory"
2. **Description**: "Need to check @Warehouse-A inventory levels for @Product-Colombian-Coffee and coordinate with @John-Smith"
3. **Save** → System automatically creates:
   - Task relates to Warehouse-A (location relationship)
   - Task relates to Product-Colombian-Coffee (product relationship)
   - Task relates to John-Smith (assignment relationship)

### **Creating a Product (New Experience)**
1. **Name**: "Colombian Premium Coffee"
2. **Description**: "Premium blend sourced from @Supplier-Colombian-Farms for @Brand-CafeMuralla"  
3. **SKU Generation**: System generates `CAF-COL-100-001` using templates
4. **Save** → System automatically creates:
   - Product relates to Supplier-Colombian-Farms (supplier relationship)
   - Product relates to Brand-CafeMuralla (brand relationship)

### **Viewing Task Details (New Experience)**
- **Task Information**: Standard task fields
- **Relationships Panel**: Visual relationship manager showing:
  - Who's assigned (via relationships)
  - What products are involved (via mentions)
  - Which projects it belongs to (via relationships)
  - All interactions and history
- **Comments**: @ mention system creates relationships as users collaborate
